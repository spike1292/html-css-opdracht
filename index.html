          Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design,
          build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too
          gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we
          saw each day in our work.

          The most significant things we can think about, when we think about
          Apollo, is that it has opened for us, for us being the World, a
          challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of
          that future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the
          young people all over the world. Learning to live and learning to work
          together. In order to remind all the peoples of the World, in so many
          countries throughout the world, that this is what we all are striving
          for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical
          of what we have here in the valley of Taurus Littrow. It's a rock
          composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably
          from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock
          of all sizes and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even
          colors that have grown together to become a cohesive rock outlasting
          the nature of Space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very
          peaceful manner. When we return this rock or some of the others like
          it to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so many of
          the countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol
          of what our feelings are, what the feelings of the Apollo Program are,
          and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the
          future.

          Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
          everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
          every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate
          of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
          ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every
          hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every
          king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
          hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every
          corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
          saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote
          of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

          The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
          rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in
          glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a
          fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
          inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
          distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
          misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
          their hatreds.

        <p>
          Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we
          have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this
          point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great
          enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there
          is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
          nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could
          migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment
          the Earth is where we make our stand.

          It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
          experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
          human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
          underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
          and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
          ever known.

          I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline
          travel is today. I’m convinced, however, that the true future of space
          travel does not lie with government agencies — NASA is still obsessed
          with the idea that the primary purpose of the space program is science
          — but real progress will come from private companies competing to
          provide the ultimate adventure ride, and NASA will receive the
          trickle-down benefits.
