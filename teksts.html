<h2>Gene Kranz - Tough and Competent</h2>
<p>
  Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect.
  Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or
  test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the
  schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work.
</p>
<p>
  “Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators
  were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the
  flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life.
  Not one of us stood up and said, ‘Dammit, stop!’ I don’t know what Thompson’s
  committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find. We are the cause! We
  were not ready! We did not do our job. We were rolling the dice, hoping that
  things would come together by launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would
  take a miracle. We were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would
  slip before we did.
</p>
<p>
  “From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: ‘Tough’ and
  ‘Competent.’ Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we
  fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we
  walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we
  will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our
  knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect.
</p>
<p>
  When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first
  thing you will do there is to write ‘Tough and Competent’ on your blackboards.
  It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will
  remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are
  the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.

<h2>Gene Cernan - Symbol of Apollo</h2>
<p>
  The most significant things we can think about, when we think about Apollo, is
  that it has opened for us, for us being the World, a challenge of the future.
  The door is now cracked, but the promise of that future lies in the young
  people, not just in America, but the young people all over the world. Learning
  to live and learning to work together. In order to remind all the peoples of
  the World, in so many countries throughout the world, that this is what we all
  are striving for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock,
  typical of what we have here in the valley of Taurus Littrow. It's a rock
  composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably from all
  parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock of all sizes and
  shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown
  together to become a cohesive rock outlasting the nature of Space, sort of
  living together in a very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we return this
  rock or some of the others like it to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of
  this rock with so many of the countries throughout the world. We hope that
  this will be a symbol of what our feelings are, what the feelings of the
  Apollo Program are, and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and
  harmony in the future.

<h2>Carl Sagan - Pale Blue Dot</h2>
<p>
  Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone
  you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who
  ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering,
  thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every
  hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
  civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother
  and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,
  every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
  saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust
  suspended in a sunbeam.
</p>
<p>
  The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of
  blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and
  triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think
  of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this
  pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how
  frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how
  fervent their hatreds.
</p>
<p>
  Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some
  privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale
  light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In
  our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from
  elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
</p>
<p>
  The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere
  else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit,
  yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we
  make our stand.
</p>
<p>
  It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
  experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
  conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our
  responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and
  cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

<h2>Buzz Aldrin - Magnificent Desolation</h2>
<p>
  I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline travel is
  today. I’m convinced, however, that the true future of space travel does not
  lie with government agencies — NASA is still obsessed with the idea that the
  primary purpose of the space program is science — but real progress will come
  from private companies competing to provide the ultimate adventure ride, and
  NASA will receive the trickle-down benefits.
